# cs-134

This is the repo for cs 134. The bmoHanoi package controls the 6 DOF robot that successfully plays the Towers of Hanoi game, without
any Aruco markers. Necessary features for the robot included a PID feedback loop to hone onto a specific color for more accurate measurements of the donut colors, 
Kinematic Equations to control the motors, a state machine class to represent the robots states, among many other complications.
